# Changelog

### 2.0.0
- Initial version

### 2.0.1
- Fixed datapack versions so it's no longer invalid.

### 2.0.2
- Fixed gravity blocks spawning (gravel, sand etc)
- Fixed that blocks like Chorus blocks can spawn and stay there. Only water and air are not allowed at the oneblock location, if found it will spawn a new block.
- Added friendly mob spawns
- Added difficulty based spawns (Easy has more frequent item drops and friendly spawns while having less enemies spawn, normal is unchanged, hard will spawn more frequent and harder enemies and less frequent friendly or item spawns)
- Added aquatic mob spawns (if under the one block is enough water)

### 2.0.3
- Added monster spawns for The Nether and The End
  > If playing with the void Nether and void End datapacks enabled, triggering a mob wave will include monsters from that dimension. So for example, Blazes and Wither Skeletons can now spawn as part of the mob wave in The Nether.
