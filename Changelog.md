### 2.0.1
- Fixed datapack versions so it's no longer invalid.

### 2.0.2
- Fixed gravity blocks spawning (gravel, sand etc)
- Fixed that blocks like Chorus blocks can spawn and stay there. Only water and air are not allowed at the oneblock location, if found it will spawn a new block.
- Added friendly mob spawns
